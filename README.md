# JackOSplosion
The Halloween 2016 Ability made for ProjectKorra!

###Usage
Clicking fires a haunted pumpkin in the direction you are looking. The pumpkin makes spooky sounds and haunts any players or mobs that it hits. Haunted players/mobs will be blinded with a pumpkin, attacked, and will hear screeching noises for a few seconds.

###Config
In the `config.yml` under the section `ExtraAbilities.StrangeOne101.JackOSplosion`, there are 3 options that you can configure.

- **Damage** - The amount of damage done (in half hearts) to players/mobs that are haunted. Will damage them 3 times.
- **Cooldown** - The cooldown in milliseconds
- **Range** - How far the ability can travel before exploding if it hasn't hit anything solid

###Lisense
You can copy, edit and redistribute all the code for JackOSplosion as long as you keep StrangeOne101 as one of the original authors. You may use parts of this code for your own abilities or plugins but don't have to credit me as long as your project isn't based off this one.
